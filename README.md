# 🤖 AI-Powered Resume Analyzer using AWS Lambda, AWS Bedrock, Textract & Comprehend

A cloud-native serverless project built entirely on the **AWS Free Tier**, this application extracts resume content from images or PDFs uploaded to an S3 bucket and analyzes them using **Amazon Textract**,**Amazon Lambda**, **Amazon Comprehend**, and **Amazon Bedrock** (Claude v2) to generate AI-driven resume improvement feedback. Accessible and scalable!

---

## 🖥️ Lambda Function - Core Logic

Here’s a simplified view of what happens in the code:

1. **Triggered by File Upload** to S3 bucket.
2. Uses **Textract** to extract lines of text from the resume.
3. Sends extracted text to **Comprehend** to detect skills and entities.
4. Passes text to **Amazon Bedrock (Claude)** to generate AI-powered suggestions.
5. Returns structured output: raw text, list of skills, and tailored feedback.

## 🌐 What You're Building:
A serverless system where you upload a **resume (PDF/image)** to S3, and behind the scenes:
1. **Text is extracted** with **Textract**
2. **Skills/entities detected** via **Comprehend**
3. **AI-powered suggestions** are generated using **Bedrock (Claude v2)**
4. All is handled using **AWS Lambda**, triggered automatically.

## 💻 How to Deploy (Step-by-Step)

---

### 🪜 Step 1: Set Up Your AWS Account
- Sign up at [https://aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) (Free Tier is fine)
- Create an **IAM User** with permissions for:
- [S3, Lambda, Textract, Comprehend, Bedrock] File [iam_roles.md]
- You can use `AdministratorAccess` for quick setup (not recommended for production)

---

### 🪜 Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket -- File [s3_bucket_config.md]
This is where resumes are uploaded.
1. Go to **S3 Console**
2. Click **Create bucket**
3. Name it: `resume-analyzer-container`
4. Uncheck **“Block all public access”**
5. Click **Create**
6. (Optional) Set up **Event Notification** to trigger Lambda on upload

---

### 🪜 Step 3: Create Your Lambda Function -- File [lambda_function.py]
This handles all the backend logic.

1. Go to **Lambda Console**
2. Click **Create function**
3. Choose:
   - **Author from scratch**
   - Runtime: **Python 3.9**
4. Upload your Lambda code (from `lambda/resumeAnalyzer_pranamika/lambda_function.py`)
5. Assign permissions: File [iam_roles.md]
   - S3: `GetObject`
   - Textract: `DetectDocumentText`
   - Comprehend: `DetectEntities`, `DetectKeyPhrases`
   - Bedrock: `InvokeModel`
6. Set up an **S3 trigger**:
   - Trigger Lambda when a new file is uploaded to the bucket

---

### 🪜 Step 4: (Optional) Set Up API Gateway
To call Lambda via HTTP:
1. Go to **API Gateway**
2. Create **REST API**
3. Set up a **POST method** connected to your Lambda
4. Deploy and note the **public URL**

---

### 🪜 Step 5: Test the Flow -- File [Test_file.md]
1. Upload a PDF/image resume to the S3 bucket
2. Lambda will:
   - Extract text via **Textract**
   - Identify entities/skills using **Comprehend**
   - Generate resume feedback using **Claude (Bedrock)**
3. The output will include:
   - Raw text
   - Skills list
   - Smart feedback

## 🧪 Sample Output  [\sample_output.md]
```json
{
  "resume_text": "Experienced Cloud Engineer with AWS & DevOps background...",
  "skills": [
    { "Text": "AWS", "Type": "ORGANIZATION" },
    { "Text": "DevOps", "Type": "OTHER" }
  ],
  "feedback": "You can improve your resume by detailing certifications and quantifying project impact..."
}
```

## 🗂 Files You Need to Upload
- `lambda_function.py` → For your Lambda function
- `requirements.txt` (optional) → Only needed if you deploy via CLI with dependencies
- `resumeAnalyzer_pranamika.yaml` → CloudFormation script (optional)
- `architecture_diagram.png` → For documentation

---

## ✅ Deployment Checklist
